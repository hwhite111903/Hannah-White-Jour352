        <h1>Is Physical Music Making a Comeback?</h1>
        <h2>Vinyls and CDs see stronger growth than their digital counterpart from 2021 to 2024.</h2>
        <h3>By Hannah White</h3>
        <p>
            Over the past couple years, physical music formats like vinyl and CDs have been having a resurgence.
            <br />
            <br />
            While digital streaming still dominates the music industry, recent data shows that physical music sales are
            growing at a surprising rate. Showing that just between 2021 to 2023, vinyl revenue sales rose from $1,044.6
            million to $1,350.2 million.
            <br />
            <br />
            In recent years, vinyl and CD sales have even outperformed the growth of streaming services. With an overall
            revenue growth of 10.5% in 2023 compared to streamings 8.1% at that same time.
            <br />
            <br />

            This trend suggests that more people are turning back to physical music.
